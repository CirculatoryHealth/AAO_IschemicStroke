# Columns
A short description of the columns in the meta-analysis summary files.

# Marker      - this is the marker name

# Allele2     - the second allele for this marker in the first file where it occurs
# Freq1       - weighted average of frequency for allele 1 across all studies
# FreqSE      - corresponding standard error for allele frequency estimate
# MinFreq     - minimum frequency for allele 1 across all studies
# MaxFreq     - maximum frequency for allele 1 across all studies
# Effect      - overall estimated effect size for allele1
# StdErr      - overall standard error for effect size estimate
# P-value     - meta-analysis p-value
# Direction   - summary of effect direction for each study, with one '+' or '-' per study
